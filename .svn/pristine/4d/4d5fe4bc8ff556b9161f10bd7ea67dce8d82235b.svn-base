INSTANCES

File name:
"A_B_C_D_E.txt"
where
"A" = class: U (uniform) of NU (non uniform)
"B" = range: 1 (range = [1, 100]), 2 (range = [1, 1000]), 3 (range = [1, 10000])
"C" = number of jobs (n): (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000)
"D" = number of machines (m): (5, 10, 25)
"E" = progressive number from 0 to 9 for each class, range, n and m

File format:
Each instance file is written in the form:
m (number of machines)
n (number of jobs)
p[1] p[2] .... p[n] (processing times)

SOLUTIONS

File name:
As the correspondiong instance, preceded by "SOL_"

File format:
Each file contains:
Number of machines (m)
Number of jobs (n)
Lower Bound (LB)
Upper Bound (UB)
Check if solution is optimal (1 if optimal, 0 otherwise)
For each machine:
a line with jobs (numbers) assigned to this machine
a line with processing times of the jobs assigned to this machine
a line with the total completion time of the machine
